The purpose of this section is to show how the principles outlined in the Thinking Guide of the website can be applied to real-world social, political and contemporary issues — issues that are often messy, emotional, and full of competing claims.

These examples do **not** represent universal conclusions. They are **my** conclusions, reached by applying the same process I advocate throughout the Thinking Guide section: starting from a clean slate, rejecting untestable claims, applying first principles (testability, evidence, objectivity, reliability), recognising our evolutionary heritage (human history), and thinking critically and independently.

In some cases, particularly where **objective evidence is overwhelming**, it is reasonable to expect that different people will arrive at the same conclusion. Objective questions have correct answers — or at least, better and worse ones.

But in many real-world dilemmas, we are dealing with **intersubjective consequences** of objective facts. Here, reasonable people can weigh the same evidence differently, based on their priorities, values, or interpretation of the data. That’s not a flaw in the method — it’s a reflection of reality’s complexity.

The goal is not uniformity of opinion. The goal is **intellectual honesty**. If you start with a clean slate, use reliable evidence, and follow a consistent process of appraisal, then — even if we disagree — we are still playing the same game, by the same rules.

Each case study begins with a hard question — framed as if your life, freedom, or future depended on getting the answer right. Because, in a way, it often does.
