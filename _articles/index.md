This website is written for curious minds of all backgrounds, not just academics or experts. That means I’ve kept the main pages as clear, straightforward, and jargon-free as possible. Big words and complex ideas aren’t avoided because they’re bad — but because the goal here is understanding and accessibility.

To keep things focused, I’ve tried not to go off on long tangents or overload each page with side notes. But sometimes, a topic deserves a closer look. That’s where this section comes in.

Here, you’ll find a growing collection of *optional* articles that dig deeper into certain subjects. These pieces might explore extra detail, offer more evidence, or take a more analytical or academic tone. When a topic on the main site hints at something more, you’ll often see a link pointing here.

Whether you’re after additional context, historical background, or just enjoy diving into the “how” and “why,” these articles are here if and when you want them.
